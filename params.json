It uses Slack's Web API format and is written in Python 3.\r\n\r\nMore info on Slack bots can be found [here.](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)\r\n\r\nI call this \"HP's Dragon\", but it can easily be renamed within the file dragon.py (which can also be renamed).\r\n\r\nThe bot's commands can be found [here](https://github.com/jdenson/HP-s-Dragon/blob/master/COMMANDS.md)\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nThis is a standalone program and as such it is easy to install.\r\n\r\nRemember that you must be running (as) Python 3.4 or later.\r\n\r\n1.

Update token.txt with your API token (make sure the file only contains one line)\r\n\t1. You will need to generate your API token either with a new integration [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot), or with your own Web API authentication [here](https://api.slack.com/web)\r\n4. Assign the bot a username in the provided field.\r\n5. Make sure to include the necessary information such as Team and *your* username. The bot REQUIRES this info to function properly.\r\n6.
