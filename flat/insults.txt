yo momma's so fat, she got baptized at Sea World.
I heard you put ketchup on your hot dog.
I bet you think Game of Thrones is just okay.
you can’t even parallel park.
I saw you bring 13 items to the express lane.
you think Godfather 3 was a good film.
I bet you eat pizza with a fork.
you still have a Blockbuster card.
someone told me you bought sharknado insurance.
you probably prefer store brand cereal.
I read you DVR Full House reruns.
I watched you fall down a stair climber.
you would probably do absolutely nothing for a Klondike Bar.
you are a twatwaffle.
you think What’s Up? by Four Non-Blondes is better without the He-Man video.
the smartest thing that ever came out of your mouth was a dick.
I called your boyfriend gay and he hit me with his purse.
don’t let your mind wander, it’s too small to be out there by itself.
you’d better hide, the garbage collector is coming.
you’ll never be the man your mother is.
you grow on people...kinda like cancer.
whatever it is that’s eating you, it must be suffering horribly.
you do the work of three men: Larry, Curly, and Moe.
you have a face like a million bucks. All green and wrinkled.
the best part of you once dribbled down your mother’s leg.
